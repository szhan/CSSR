Title: Causal State Splitting Reconstruction

Description: This is a R wrapper around the CSSR program originally written by
    Kristina Klinkner. The theory behind the CSSR algorithm was developed by Cosma
    Shalizi and Kristina Klinkner, under the sponsorship of James Crutchfield.
    Briefly, CSSR creates separate causal states for each history of data with
    a singular probability distribution. History length increases incrementally
    until cutoff point is reached. Then, it removes transient states, determinizes
    remaining states, and calculates various metrics for the resulting state
    machine.
